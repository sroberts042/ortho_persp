Various test cases showing orthographic and perspective projections


draw various lines   	      	// '1'  
orthographic test	    	// '2'  
orthographic scale test		// '3'  
orthographic rotate test	// '4'  
draw a face  		       	// '5'  
draw four faces		        // '6'  
orthographic cube test		// '7'  
orthographic cube test 2	// '8'  
perspective cube test		// '9'  
perspective cube test 2		// '0'  
perspective axes test 		// 'p'  
orthographic axes test 		// 'o'  


Project was to implement mathlib functions to calculate orthographic and perspective projections (TODO functions)
Math functions copied from previous project written by me
test functions were provided and not written by me

Project from graphics class Summer 2015
